	\textbf{Abstract.} In order to incorporate ideas from algebraic topology in concrete contexts such as topological data analysis and topological lattice field theories, one needs effective constructions of concepts defined only abstractly or axiomatically.
	In this talk, I will discuss such constructions for certain invariants derived from the cup product on the cohomology of spaces or, more specifically, from an $E_\infty$-structure on their cochains.
	Together with allowing for the concrete computation of finer cohomological invariants in persistent homology --Steenrod barcodes-- these effective constructions also reveal combinatorial information connected to convex geometry and higher category theory.
