	\textbf{Abstract.} In order to incorporate ideas from algebraic topology in concrete contexts such as TDA and lattice TQFT, one needs effective constructions of concepts defined only abstractly or axiomatically.
	In this talk, I will discuss such constructions for certain invariants derived from the cup product on the cohomology of spaces or, more specifically, from an $E_\infty$-structure on their cochains.
	When allowing for the computation of finer cohomological invariants, these effective constructions also reveal combinatorial information that, as we will see, is connected to convex geometry and higher category theory.
